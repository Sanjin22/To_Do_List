## Overview
This is a To-Do List web application that allows you to manage your tasks. You can create two types of lists: one for your daily tasks and another for work-related tasks. You can add, delete, and mark tasks as done. The daily tasks list also displays the current date and day of the week.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js. It utilizes the body-parser middleware to extract data from user input and store it on the server.
